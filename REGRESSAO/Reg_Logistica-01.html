<h1>Introdução</h1>
<p>Diferente do que vimos no artigo sobre <a href="./RegLinear-01.html">Regressão Linear</a> onde criamos um modelo de ML supervisionado para fazer inferências sobre uma variável dependente contínua, neste artigo iremos criar modelos onde a variável dependente obedece à uma distribuição de <strong>Bernoulli</strong>. Neste caso, temos uma variável dependente dicotômica (0 ou 1), tendo a probabilidade de um evento ocorrer (<span class="math inline">p</span>) e dele não ocorrer (<span class="math inline">1-p</span>).</p>
</section>
<section id="base-de-dados" class="level1">
<h1>Base de Dados</h1>
<p>Para os próximos exemplos iremos utilizar a base de dados <em>TitanicSurvival</em> que possui informações sobre 1309 passageiros do navio Titanic. Usaremos a variável <em>survived</em> como variável dependente e as variáveis sexo, idade e classe como variáveis explicativas.</p>

<p>Para nossos experimentos, iremos selecionar como variável dependente a <strong>survived</strong> que indica se a pessoa sobreviveu ou não à tragédia do navio Titanic. Ou seja, iremos criar modelo preditivo que, com base em variáveis explicativas presentes (sexo, idade e classe do passageiro) em nossa amostra de dados, tentarão prever se uma pessoa sobreviveria ou não.</p>

<h1>Logito</h1>
<p>Diferente da regressão linear, onde a saída era um valor quantitativo definido pelas variáveis preditoras e respectivos parâmetros calculados para minimizar os erros do modelo, na regressão <strong>logística binomial</strong>, iremos calcular a <strong>probabilidade</strong> (<span class="math inline">p</span>) do evento <strong>ocorrer</strong> ou <strong>não ocorrer</strong> com base no comportamente das variáveis preditoras. Ou seja, a variável dependente será categórica e <strong>dicotômica</strong> (zero ou um).</p>
<p>Se definirmos um vetor <span class="math inline">Z</span> com as variáveis explicativas como:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">Z_i = \alpha + \beta_1 * X_1 + \beta_2 * X_{2} + \beta_k * X_{k}</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">Z</span> é conhecido como <strong>logito</strong> e não representa a variável dependente prevista (<span class="math inline">\hat{y}</span>) como em um modelo de regressão linear simples, mas sim equivale ao <strong>logaritmo natural</strong> (<span class="math inline">ln</span>) da <strong>chance</strong> (<em>log odds</em>).</p>

<p>Apesar de usarmos no mesmo sentido de <em>probabilidade</em>, <strong>Chance</strong> (<em>odds</em>) é um conceito estatístico definido pela razão do evento ocorrer e do evento não ocorrer. <em>Chance</em> e <em>Probabildade</em> <strong>NÃO</strong> são a mesma coisa.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">chance (odds)_{Y_i=1} = \dfrac{p_i}{1 - p_i}</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Já que nosso objetivo é calcular a <strong>probabilidade</strong> <em>p</em> do evento <strong>ocorrer</strong>, temos então:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">p_i = \dfrac{1}{1 + \mathrm{e}^{-Z_i}}</span></p>
<p>E a probabilidade do evento <strong>não ocorrer</strong> é:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">1 - p_i = \dfrac{1}{1 + \mathrm{e}^{Z_i}}</span></p>
<p>Ao criarmos um gráfico de um conjunto de logitos aleatório, por exemplo de -5 à +5, temos uma curva conhecida como “curva S” ou “sigmóide”:</p>

<h1>Máxima Verossimilhança</h1>
<p>Enquanto na regressão linear, utilizamos os mínimos quadrados ordinários (OLS) para fazer as estimativas dos coeficientes, aqui iremos estimar os coeficientes <strong>maximizando</strong> a função de verossimilhança (likelihood).</p>
<p><span class="math display">LL=\sum_{n=i}^{n} [(Y_i) * ln(\dfrac {\mathrm{e}^{Z_i}}
{1 + \mathrm{e}^{Z_i}})] + [(1-Y_i) * ln(\dfrac {1}
{1 + \mathrm{e}^{Z_i}})] = máx</span></p>
<p>Fazemos isto, pois queremos maximizar a probabildade do evento ocorrer em cada uma das observações da amostra. Isto gera uma função produtória, que após manupulações matemáticas, torna-se a função somatória apresentada anteriormente. É por isso que pretendemos maximizar a função logaritima de verossimilhança (<em>maximum likelihood estimation</em> - MLE).</p>
<p>O cáculo dos coeficientes <span class="math inline">\alpha</span> e <span class="math inline">\beta</span> para maximizar a função de verossimilhança é feito automaticamente quando criamos um modelo de regressão logística binária no R, porém, iremos apenas exemplificar, como isto poderia ser feito manualmente.</p>

<p>Já que não fizemos a criação da variável dependente <strong>dummy</strong> manualmente, é importante sabermos o que estamos tratando como “evento”, pois o “yes” e “no” da variável não necessariamente determina a probabildade do evento.</p>
<p>Podemos definir manualmente 0 para o não evento e 1 para o evento em nosso dataset, mas como temos a variável do tipo fator (factor), o R pega o primeiro nível por ordem alfabética e define como não evento e o outro como evento. Veja:</p>

<p>Observe também que a variável explicativa sexo (sex) deve ser “dummizada”. Não fizemos este processo manualmente, pois a função glm() já entende este processo devido ao tipo da variável no dataset ser do tipo <strong>fator</strong> (factor). Mas podemos confirmar que a variável referência foi a “female”, devido à ordem no fator.</p>

<p>Nos modelos de regressão linear, onde temos o R2 para representar a porcentagem de variância da y por se tratar de variável quantitativa, aqui, na logística binária isto não faz mais sentido, pois temos uma variável y dicotômica, então acabamos interpretando atraveś da <strong>probabilidade</strong> do evento ocorrer ou não.</p>
<p>Através dos valores dos coeficientes, podemos calcular nosso <strong>logito</strong> (Z), que equivale ao logaritmo natual da <strong>chance</strong> (odds), conforme vimos anteriormente:</p>

<p>Veja que a diferença da <strong>chance</strong> (odds) entre o modelo nulo e modelo é o valor do <span class="math inline">\beta</span> de X1 (sexo) e que a chance do modelo dividida pela chance nulo é o que chamamos de <strong>razão de chance</strong> (<em>odds ratio</em> - OR). Isso é importante quando formos interpretar os coeficientes posteriormente.</p>
<p>Como temos como categoria de referência “yes”, ou seja, “sobreviveu”, na variável dependente e como categoria de referência “female” na variável X1 (sex), então os valores do modelo nulo, são referentes à probabilidade de sibrevivência das mulhares (X1=0, sex=female), enquanto que (X1=1, sex=male) são os valores de probabilidade para homens que sobreviveram. Vejam que quanto maior o valor de <strong>chance</strong> dos homens, é menor que os das mulheres, e consequentemente, sua <strong>probabildade</strong> também é menor.</p>
<section id="coeficientes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coeficientes">Coeficientes</h2>
<p>Analisar o coeficiente dos betas (<span class="math inline">\beta</span>), é utilizado para entender se a influência é maior ou menor que a do evento não ocorrer, porém, devemos lembrar que o valor do <span class="math inline">\beta</span> corresponde ao valor da unidade <strong>logito</strong> (log da chance - <em>log odds</em>) da variável dependente quando dimuni-se X em uma unidade. Como pode-se notar, afimar que o <em>ln da chance</em> diminui em 2.425 quando a X aumenta em uma unidade não é muito interpretativo.</p>
<p>Por isso, em geral, analisamos a razão de <strong>chance</strong> (<em>odds ratio</em> - OR), ou seja, elevamos o <span class="math inline">e</span> à potência do <em>logito</em> (<span class="math inline">\mathrm{e}^Z</span>), em nosso caso, <span class="math inline">\mathrm{e}^-2.475 = 0.08843</span>.</p>
<p>Neste caso, diríamos que a chance de ocorrer o evento da Y (sobreviver), diminui em 0,00884 para cada aumento na unidade de X, como X também é dicotômica, com a categoria de referência em “female”, diríamos que a chance diminui em 0,0084 vezes quando o indivídou for homem (male).</p>

<p>Lembre-se que, apesar de usarmos os termos “chances” e “probabilidade” de forma intercambiável em nosso cotidiano, estes conceitos NÃO são iguais: Chance é a razão entre a probabilidade de um evento ocorrer sobre a probabilidade do evento não ocorrer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">chance  = \frac{p_i}{(1-p_i)}</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Podemos também obter as chances (Odds Ratio - OR) através da função <strong>odds.ratio</strong>() do pacote <strong>questionr</strong>. O interessante desta opção é que já teríamos também os intervalos de confiança (que poderiam ser calculados manualmente obviamente):</p>

<p>Em nosso exemplo, TRUE significa sobreviveu e FALSE não sobreviveu, portanto, podemos ler que acertamos 339 e erramos 161 dos sobreviventes e acertamos 682 dos não sobreviventes e erramos 127 dos não sobreviventes.</p>
<p>Nós também definimos um corte ou <strong>cut-off</strong> de 50%, ou seja, se a probabilidade do evento ocorrer for maior que 50% definiremos como evento, caso contrário, como não evento.</p>
<p>Atraveś desta matriz, utilizaremos o pacote <strong>caret</strong> com a função <strong>confusionMatrix</strong>() para calcular a <strong>Acurácia</strong> (78%), <strong>Sensitividade</strong> (67%) e <strong>Especificidade</strong> (84%) do modelo.</p>

<p>Diferente de outros algoritmos com parcelas mais estocásticas para estimação de parâmetros, como Redes Neurais, Árvores de Decisões, etc, no modelo de regressão logística NÃO há a necessidade de separar amostra de treino e teste. Também não há a necessidade do balanceamento entre a proporção das categorias da variável dependente. Apenas quando soubermos a proporção da população, devemos fazer um ajuste no <span class="math inline">\alpha</span> da equação de probabilidade, somando o log natural da razão de proporção da população e da amostra:</p>

<section id="regressão-logística-multinomial" class="level1">
<h1>Regressão Logística Multinomial</h1>
<p>Quando nossa variável depedente (y) qualitativa possui 3 ou mais categorias, devemos criar um modelo multinomial. Diferente da regressão binária, que segue uma função bernoulli, neste caso ela segue uma <strong>função binomial</strong> (o que gera confusão, pois a fução glm(), usa family=binomial, o que é uma infelicidade).</p>
<p>A função de desnidade probabilidade da função binomial segue a seguinte fórmula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">p(Y_im) = \prod_{m=0}^{M-1}(p_{i_m})^{Y_{im}}</span></p>
<p>De forma similar à regressão logística binária, aqui iremos gerar uma função de verossimilhança, porém com base em dummies da variável Y, ou seja, criando um logito (<span class="math inline">Z (m-0,1,...M-1)</span>) para cada combinação das categorias da variável dependente (M) menos uma categoria de referência.</p>
<p>A função de máxima verossimilhança que devemos maximizar neste caso é:</p>
<p><span class="math display">LL = \sum_{i=0}^n  \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \bigg[ (Y_{im} . ln\bigg(\frac{e^{Z_{im}}}  {\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}\ .e^{Z_{im}}}\bigg]\bigg)=máx</span></p>
<p>Para criarmos um modelo multinomial, iremos utilziar a função <strong>multinom</strong>() do pacote <strong>nnet</strong>.</p>
<p>Neste exemplo, iremos utilizar a mesma base de dados, mas para efeitos didáticos, iremos definir nossa variável dependente como a classe do passageiro (passengerClass) que tem 3 categorias. Por isso, iremos estimas 2 logitos. Cada logito terá um <span class="math inline">\alpha</span> e mais um <span class="math inline">\beta</span> para cada variável explicativa (X). Aqui, usaremos apenas a variável “survived” pois já vimos que existia associação entre ambas anteriormente.</p>

<p>Infelizmente, a função <strong>summ</strong>() do pacote jtools, não suporta modelos criados pelo nnet, portanto, teremos que calcular o <span class="math inline">\chi^2</span> manualmente. Também não temos o teste Z de Wald na saída da função summary() e também deveremos calculá-los manualmente.</p>
